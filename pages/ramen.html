    <h2>ラーメン ramen</h2>
    <p><strong>Ramen</strong> (拉麺, ラーメン, <em>rāmen</em>) is a Japanese noodle soup. It consists of Chinese-style wheat noodles served in a broth, often flavoured with soy sauce or miso. Nearly every region in Japan has its own variation of ramen.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>thumb-sized piece ginger, sliced, plus a few slices cut into fine matchsticks to serve (optional)</li>
        <li>1½ tbsp white miso paste</li>
        <li>1 tbsp neri goma (white sesame paste) or tahini</li>
        <li>15g dried shiitake mushrooms</li>
        <li>1l good-quality vegan stock</li>
        <li>2 tbsp soy sauce</li>
        <li>200g firm tofu, cut into chunky cubes</li>
        <li>1 tbsp cornflour</li>
        <li>1 tbsp veg or sunflower oil</li>
        <li>100g (2 x nests) ramen or rice noodles</li>
        <li>1 head pak choi, quartered</li>
        <li>2 spring onions, finely sliced, white and green parts kept separate</li>
        <li>25g ready-to-eat beansprouts</li>
        <li>1 carrot, peeled and cut into fine matchsticks</li>
        <li>sesame oil, sriracha, chopped coriander, crushed peanuts, crumbled sheets of nori or dried chilli threads (silgochu), to serve (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Method</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Crush the garlic with the back of a big knife, then put it in a saucepan with the ginger, miso, neri goma, mushrooms, stock and soy. Bring to a gentle simmer, cover and bubble for 5 mins until the ginger is soft. Strain into a clean pan and discard everything left in the strainer.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, cook the tofu. Toss it in the cornflour and heat the oil in a frying pan. Fry for a few mins on each side, being careful as you turn it that it doesn't fall apart. Cook the noodles for 1 min less than pack instructions, so they retain a little bite. Drain and leave in the pan with a little cooking water so they don't stick together.</li>
        <li>Add the pak choi and whites of the spring onions to the broth and gently reheat for 1-2 mins until the greens have just wilted.</li>
        <li>Divide the noodles between two deep bowls, ladle over the broth and veg. Top with the tofu, beansprouts, carrot and ginger matchsticks, green parts of the spring onions and a drizzle of sesame oil, plus the other toppings, if you like.</li>
    </ol>
